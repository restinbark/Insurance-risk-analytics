🔹 Step 3: Add and Commit the README
bash
Copy code
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README with project overview for Task 1"
git push origin task-1
✅ Once done, you’re now ready to proceed to Task 1.2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Would you like help creating:

A starter notebook for EDA?

A requirements.txt file?

A .gitignore file?

Let me know, or we can jump straight into the EDA.

Great question! The directory structure you've listed is a project scaffolding—a visual map of your repository’s organization. Including it in your README.md is highly recommended and serves several key purposes:

✅ Why Include the Project Structure in README?
📦 Clarity: Helps others (and your future self) understand where to find or place files.

🚧 Guidance: Assists collaborators in following the expected organization.

🧼 Professionalism: Shows you're following clean coding and data science project practices.

📌 How to Add It to README
Yes, you can add it exactly like this in your README.md:
